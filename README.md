## ðŸ“¦ Dataset: Hotel_Reviews.csv

The dataset `Hotel_Reviews.csv` is too large to be stored on GitHub (over 100MB).

ðŸ”— **[Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z14B8GhMH8D2kXPhcEHKexL_2UhbWjOj/view?usp=drive_link)**

After downloading, place the file in the root directory of the project so it can be accessed by the notebook:

./Hotel_Reviews.csv

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

It's recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g. `venv` or `conda`) and Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

This project was developed with **Python 3.12.9**.

### âœ… Install dependencies

If you are using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Make sure your Jupyter kernel is using the same Python environment where the dependencies are installed.

If you are using conda, you can first create and activate a virtual environment (e.g. xxx) and then install the dependencies:

conda create --name xxx python=3.12
conda activate xxx
pip install -r requirements.txt
